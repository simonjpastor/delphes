city should be basking in the political spotlight this week as commission president ursula von der leyen delivers her first state of the european union address from its european parliament chamber but von der leyen will instead make her speech in brussels after the parliament once again canceled its monthly pilgrimage to strasbourg due to worries about the coronavirus the parliament has not held a plenary session in strasbourg since february  its longest ever absence from the picturesque alsatian city that remains its official seat even if most of its work is now done in brussels and strasbourg is feeling the economic pain particularly its taxi drivers restauranteurs and hoteliers the city had hoped to welcome the parliament back this month having put in place a special health plan to minimize coronavirus risks but the parliaments leaders werent convinced many meps are not fans of the monthly upheaval and have voted on multiple occasions to scrap the strasbourg seat its been a rather dark year for strasbourg from an economical standpoint said jeanne barseghian the citys recently elected green mayor canceling the session altogether was an additional hard blow the citys supporters are also worried about the wider message sent by the cancellation  and the prospect of a renewed debate about whether the regular caravan to and from strasbourg can be justified the fact that the cancellation of strasbourg was reported in the media all over the world means for the average person dont come to strasbourg it is dangerous dont come to strasbourg the health situation is precarious and youre taking a big risk said pierre siegel the president of the local association of hotel and restaurant owners we fear a snowball effect he said in a video posted on the website of local daily dernires nouvelles dalsace and we really dont need that many meps are not fans of the monthly upheaval and have voted on multiple occasions to scrap the strasbourg seat the cost of maintaining it is some  million per year according to a report by the european court of auditors which critics argue makes it a prime example of the eu wasting public money but ending strasbourgs role as the parliaments official home would need the consent of all eu member countries  and the french government has made clear it would block any such move clment beaune frances european affairs minister traveled to the city on monday to declare his governments unwavering attachment to strasbourg as seat of the european parliament and european capital french officials argue that the history of strasbourg which has had periods under both french and german rule make it a treasured symbol of european peace and reconciliation they contend it is also important for eu institutions to be dispersed around the bloc to avoid over centralization and ensure the economic benefits of such bodies are shared widely in a normal month up to meps more than parliamentary workers and countless lobbyists journalists and others make the switch to strasbourg for a plenary session after a day of lawmaking and meetings many of those temporary visitors hop into a chauffeur driven car or taxi to talk business over a choucroute and glass of pinot noir at one of the citys countless winstubs one local taxi company taxi which employs more than drivers says it has lost at least percent of its revenue due to the coronavirus crisis  and part of that is down to the lack of parliamentary clients our taxi drivers cant make their numbers anymore some have left others cant pay for costs there is much less work than before said company boss hakim kerkoub if that lasts it will end up killing us christophe andt the founder of au pont corbeau one of the citys landmark restaurants said the virus and the cancelation of the monthly parliament sessions had had a very big impact on the business the restaurant with its signature dish of jamboneau grill grilled knuckle of ham is a favorite with meps and advisers seventy to percent of our customers are regulars and a big chunk of them are meps said andt whose business has been going for more than years now we are scared that strasbourg will just be wiped out of the map if we as the eu are breaking the good rules human rights rule of law why should we stick to the stupid ones three seats  nico semsrott green mep the hotel cathdrale which reopened in june after months of closure due to the coronavirus crisis will shut its doors again this week due to lack of reservations a receptionist said the hotel which overlooks the citys stunning gothic cathedral is generally full during plenary sessions european parliament president david sassoli sought on monday to reassure the people of strasbourg that the legislature had not abandoned them on behalf of all our members i extend a warm greeting to the mayor and people of strasbourg where we hope to return soon he said in a statement but that warmth was not immediately apparent in the words of all meps particularly those critical of the parliaments homes in three different cities it has offices in luxembourg as well as brussels and strasbourg if we as the eu are breaking the good
